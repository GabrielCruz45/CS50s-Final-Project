# CS50's FINAL PROJECT: Unsupervised Drum Sorter

<https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/project/>

    This is the repository for my final project of Harvard's CS50 class.

    I used an Gemini, Google's LLM to brainstorm ideas for the final project. The prompt and answer being used are available in the project's repository: project/docs/LLM_PROMPT.md and project/docs/LLM_PROMPT_X.png for the screen shots (X == screen shot number).

    I am using uv as the package manager. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pttmsBSi8M>

    The folder structure is based on this blog post I found on the web:
